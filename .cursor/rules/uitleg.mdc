# Explanation

- Import the excel from the project into a webpage, performance is important so convert when needed.
- Use node.js
- I want to be able to customize design styling of the content. 
- Make tabs for every spreadsheet-tab in the excel file.
- Don't use tables but use html5 flexbox.
- Don't skip columns when reading in data. Empty cells should also be displayed.
- Every column in the excel is a separate class. Column 1 is class level-1, column 2 is class level-2 etcetera.
- Every level class consists of 2 children: a header div and a content div. These are called the name of the class + header, or + content. For example level-1-header and level-1-content. The header title of the excel goes in the header, and the data of the specific cell goes in the content. 
- Important: even if the cell is empty, it still is participating, just empty in the final result.
- Every column except the first can be a child of the one left of it. If one column has multiple children, they are shown in row in the full width of the parent div. 
- Important! if the level-x class is a parent of another, the data from the cells go into the level-x header, and the content has the designated children. 
- The pdf-export should only have level-1 options to choose from. 
- THe pdf layout should strive to look the same as the webpage. It should have the same structure, flex column and row layout. 
- If the content doesnt fit inside the pdf, the content must responsively adjust so that it will fit. Flexbox will make sure of it.
